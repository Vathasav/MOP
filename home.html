  <p style="font-size:140%;">Many real world problems are of Multi-Objective nature. The objectives that have to be optimized are often conflicting and competing with each other. The decision making between optimizing multiple objectives is a challenging activity, where inclining towards one objective influences other objectives and vice-versa. For managing such multiple objective problems, decision support tools could aid the decision maker in finding a compromise between the multiple objectives. </p> <br>
<p style="font-size:140%;">Managing technical debt in a software system is a multi-objective problem involves that trade-off between short-term and long-term value: taking shortcuts to optimize the delivery of features in the short term incurs debt, analogous to financial debt, that must be paid off later to optimize long-term success. We have created a decision support tool for managing technical debt in an existing software system. The tool can be explored in the TOOL section.
