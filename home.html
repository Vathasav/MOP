  <p style="font-size:140%;">Many real world problems are of Multi-Objective nature. The objectives that have to be optimized are often conflicting and competing with each other. The decision making between optimizing multiple objectives is a challenging activity, where inclining towards one objective influences other objectives and vice-versa. For managing such multiple objective problems, decision support tools could aid the decision maker in finding a compromise between the multiple objectives. </p> <br>
<p style="font-size:140%;"> One challenging multi-objective problem is managing technical debt in a software system. Technical debt metaphor describes a situation in which
developers take shortcuts (e.g. delaying documentation and
adopting ad-hoc practices) to optimize the delivery of features
for satisfying the short-term goals (e.g. release deadline, to
achieve market share). The accrued shortcuts must be paid off to optimize long-term success of the software. For deciding when to take the shortcuts or when to fix the shortcuts, we have created a decision support tool for managing technical debt in an existing software system. The tool can be explored in the TOOL section.
