# Multi-Objective Optimization Tool

##Many real world problems are of Multi-Objective nature. The objectives that have to be optimized are often conflicting and competing with each other. The decision making between optimizing multiple objectives is a challenging activity, where inclining towards one objective influences other objectives and vice-versa. For managing such multiple objective problems, decision support tools could aid the decision maker in finding a compromise between the multiple objectives. 

## This project's goal is to develop decision supports that can aid decision makers in challenging multi-objective problems.
